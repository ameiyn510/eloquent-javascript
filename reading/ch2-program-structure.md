# Program Structure

##Intro
>In this chapter, we will start to do things that can actually be called programming. We will expand our command of the JavaScript language beyond the nouns and sentence fragments weâ€™ve seen so far, to the point where we can express some meaningful prose. -Eloquent JavaScript

##Objectives
- Obj 1
- Obj 2
- Obj 3

##Expressions and Statements
>In Chapter 1, we made some values and then applied operators to them to get new values. Creating values like this is an essential part of every JavaScript program, but it is only a part.
A fragment of code that produces a value is called an expression. Every value that is written literally (such as 22 or "psychoanalysis") is an expression.
If an expression is a sentence fragment, a statement corresponds to a full sentence in human language.  A program is simply a list of statements.

The simplest statements are expressions followed by a semi-colon.
```
42;
!false;
```

Remember:  A JavaScript statement is a line of executable code.  Only amounts to something if it affects the world.
